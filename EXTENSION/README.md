# Chrome Password Manager Extension 🔐
- This project is an experimental project that I have prepared to understand Chrome extensions and do something a little bit useful for me. 🧪
- Our main goal is to create a server and connect to that server via an extension 🧩
- There may be security gaps, as I said at the beginning, it is an experimental project. 💡
- A good example and starter for chrome extensions. 😃

# Running 🏃‍♂️
- Clone repository 🐏
- Create a `.env` file in `SERVER` folder that includes these: 
    - `MONGODB_URI`: Mongodb connection URI 📦
    - `PORT`: Server port 🚪
    - `SECRET`: Encryption / Decryption secret key 🔑
- Run `yarn i`,  `yarn build` and `yarn start:prod` in `SERVER` folder 🏗️
- Import `EXTENSION` folder as a chrome extension 🧩
